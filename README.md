# Quick Tax Calc

This is a quick calculator for the [ATO Australian Individual Tax Rates 2017/2018](https://www.ato.gov.au/Rates/Individual-income-tax-rates/).

## Usage

Type your annual pre-tax amount in the income section and see your after tax annual and fortnightly amounts.

You can use the "Save and compare" button to remember a given fortnightly amount for comparison.

The income section also allows for formulae so you can do things like:

- How might a 10% raise affect my income? - _90000 \* 1.1_
- What if I get an extra job paying 500 a week? - _90000 + 500 \* 52_
- If I go part time, how much will I get paid? - _90000 \* 3/5_

## Run instructions

`yarn start`

## Roadmap

I might add the ability to work backwards - I want to earn 3000 a fortnight, how much do I need to earn?
